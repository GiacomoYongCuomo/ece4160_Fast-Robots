                                        The first iteration of the function was just designed to take a response and print it directly. For future iterations, I printed both time and temperature measurements, implementing an alternative print for when temperature is recorded.
                                        Here is the full code showing its functionality.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">This function is going to be used for all next tasks I will talk about. For all of them, to start checking for robot's output we just run the function ble.start_notify(ble.uuid['RX_STRING'], notification_handler) and we end the receiving by running the function
                                        ble.stop_notify(ble.uuid['RX_STRING']). Both functions check ble.uuid['RX_STRING'] for data sent from the robot as it is the receiver. From the Arduino side, we are sending it through the transmitter of the Bluetooth.
                                        To immediately test out Notification Handler function, I was tasked to receive the time from GET_TIME_MILLIS. Here is the Python section that shows it.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">The next task I developed was the command TIME_LOOP. Its functionality is to send to Python timestamps from the moment they were requested for a period of time of my choice, all through the Notification Handler .
                                        The period of time I decided to collect data for was 3 seconds, collecting a total of 81 timestamps. This implies that the program collects 27 messages/second. One particular occurence I found in doing this task was that sometimes the
                                        number of timestamps were more than 81 and sometimes less. I think this depended on the traffic of the Bluetooth, if the robot was running for a while and especially if other commands were requested before.
                                        Here is the code for TIME_LOOP and its output on Python.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">In this next section, I was tasked to store timestamps into an array in Arduino and then send it when requested. To do so, I preferred to implement two different commands, one to store and one to send.
                                        My reasoning for doing this is because, in a later task, I will need to implement the same system for also temperature readings. By modulating the two actions in different commands, I could store temperature readings by simply adding another array in the STORE_LOOP command.
                                        I will explain more about this in the next section.<br>
                                        One critical change I made from this moment on was switch from milliseconds to microseconds under suggestion of the TA in lab. This is because I noticced I was hitting the boundary of the array extremely quickly, despite it being very large.
                                        I will further discuss my conclusions and some possible solution in the Discussion section.<br>

                                        This can be seen from the code developed in STORE_LOOP. Differently from SEND_TIME_DATA, GET_TEMP_DATA sends informations to the Notification Handler in a particular format: "count|time|temp" where "|" is used as delimiter to handle the data.<br>

                                            <p class="mb-4">This lab was very instructive on how the Bluetooth communication between the robot and our pc works and how they will communicate data in the future labs. <br>
                                                  During the lab, I was tasked to send data from Arduino to Python both directly in real time but also through a stored array at run time. Those two methods are extremely different. Despite the first one being very fast, it pales in comparison as the second one filled the array almost immediately.
                                                  The reason for this is because the direct sending of data happens at real time, delaying due to the Serial Communication through Bluetooth. This communication is effective when we would like to see replies in real time like for the ECHO command. <br>
                                                  In the other hand, storing the data at run time is way faster as it doesn't delay due to Serial. This can be useful if we are measuring EMU or Time-of-Flight data for use for future adjustments and commands, as in this case having more data to compare may be helpful. </p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">In regard of the rate at which the Artemis Nano stores data in Arduino, I noticed an issue. When I first started storing timestamps, the array filled up of data extremely fast.
                                        Additionally, one thing I realised was that by registering the timestamps in milliseconds many entries of the array were the exact same number, as it can be seen by the following image.
                                        To fix this, under suggestion of the TA, I decided to instead register the data in microseconds as it would give me more informations. Furthermore, it would avoid the issue of filling up the array so rapidly. <br>
                                        By talking to the TA, I realised that if I wanted to avoid the array to fill up I could calculate the necessary dimension based on the RAM space of the Artemis Nano and the memory used by Arduino to compute.
                                        The Artemis Nano has 384 kB of RAM. A float takes up 4 bytes of RAM, so we can calculate that 96,000 datapoints can be stored in it (384kB/4B). Since I am storing both timestamps and temperature measurements, this is roughly 48,000 datapoints per measurement.
                                        However, we need to take into account also each string we send as they contain a certain number of bytes per character. This means I have to consider even less than 48,000 that can be sent to the notification handler before RAM runs out. </p>

                                      Within the code, it is important to understand the variable AD0_VAL which is set to 1 by default. When set to 1, it allows communication through the SPI channel, which is impossible when set to 0.

                                      The drawback is that they are subject to not exactly aligh with the normal angles. This can be seen from the pitch as, although the relative angle is a change in 90 degrees in both direction, the initial position is not at the zero angles.
                                      To mitigate this, we can try applying a complimentary filter to combine the initial precision of the Accelerometer and the noisyless effect of the Gyroscope. This applies only to pitch and roll as the Accelerometer cannot influence yaw in any way.</p>

                                      <p class="mb-4">Throughout the entirety of the lab, I implemented sme design choices that definetely influenced the efficiency of the code. <br>
                                      The first very important decision taken was between calculating data at run time, by storing it in arrays, or in real time, by sending it directly via Bluetooth.
                                      Although I initally tested all functionality by calculating the angles in real time, I decided to instead store all data in array structs (STORE_IMU) and send it via Bluetooth using another command (SEND_IMU). Both commands are here reported.
                                      This allowed me to take measurements at a higher rate (roughly 1200 per second) and therefore have more precise graphs when measuring changes in pitch, roll and yaw. </p>

                                      <p class="mb-4">Another important decision I made was to store each measured value in different struct arrays. This, although expensive in terms of RAM as each array takes a certain amount of memory, allowed me more modularity and limited the risk of filling the array with data.
                                      Lastly, as viewed by any image posted before, I decided and was able to gather IMU data for 10sec, with the draw back of a longer sending time as it is computational expensive to send roughly 12000 data points, based on the before mentioned sampling rate. </p>

                                      <li> <h4>I2C Sensor Address and Conflict with Two ToFs Sensors</h4> </li>
                                      <p class="mb-4">From the beginning of the lab, by running the example code in Example1_wire_I2C, I found the I2C address associated to one of the ToF sensor we have.
                                      The example code showed that the sensor has address 0x29 instead of the default 0x52. This is because, when connected and running, the LSB is continuously toggled between read and write with consequence
                                      of having the I2C address bit-shifted by one to the right. <br>
                                      Another challenge to face regarding I2C addresses is that both ToF sensors have the same address, so we need to change address to one of them to differentiate their measurements and to be able to run them concurrently.
                                      To do so, we hard-wire the XSHUT pin in one of the ToF to any GPIO on the Artemis Nano, in my case A0. By setting it LOW, as it is active low, it internally changes the I2C address of the sensor and allows two to be connected at the same time.</p>
                                      <li> <h4>Robot Layout</h4> </li>
                                      <p class="mb-4">Now that we are getting used to the various sensors, it's time to think about where they will physically live on the robot. I decided to place my ToFs one on the front and one on the side (probably right side). This will allow me to identify obstacles immediately in front of me, avoiding collisions when navigating the space, and on the side.
                                      The main drawback is that one of the side will be blind for the car, which I plan to overcome by doing 90 degrees stationary turns so to map my surroundings. </p>
                                      <li> <h4>Wiring</h4> </li>
                                      <p class="mb-4">Shown in the image below, it is the wiring I decided to follow for each of my sensors components. Using the four wires provided to me, I labelled each of them from 1 to 4 and draw arrows showing where each of the cables will be connected to. Additionally, for the ToF sensors, I decided to show which strand of the wire is soldered to each pin using their rispecting colors.
                                      Lastly, I drew a yellow arrow going from pin A0 to XSHUT of my second ToF which is an extra wire I soldered ussed to allow a second ToF to connect at the same time with the first one. </p>

                                      <p class="mb-4">As explained in the prelab, the first step to prepare the ToF was finding its I2C address. Using the Example1_wire_I2C file, I found out the address was 0x29, which is teh default address 0x52 bit-shifted right by one.
                                      This makes the LSB to dropped, which is the one that continuously toggles between read and write. </p>

                                      <li> <h4>Chosen Mode</h4> </li>
                                      <p class="mb-4">The next step was to choose the ranging mode that I wanted my sensors to have. After roughly testing the various modes, I decided to settle on the Long Mode (4m range) as it will allow me to range obstacle further away with enough accuracy.
                                      As the image below shows, the ToF sensor manages to have consistent results independently of teh light, at least for our robot purpose. On the other end, it show a lose of accuracy in complete dark when measuring further away, with the gain of a better standard deviation and therefore precision on the measurements.
                                      The results also show a very high imprecision for the middle range in complete light and a maybe worst accuracy in the further range. In general, this experiment made me realise the limitations of these sensors, how to use them on my robot and what the best conditions to use them are. <br>
                                      For my second ToF sensor, the one on the side, I may opted for short ranging but some experimentation with the car would be needed. </p>

                                      <li> <h4>Two ToF Sensors and IMU</h4> </li>
                                      <p class="mb-4">After testing one ToF, I hooked up both ToF and IMU sensors all together. From the image, you can see that all three were successfully connected and ready to work in parallel.</p>
                                      <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" src="assets/img/Lab3/sensors_togethers.png" alt="..." />
                                      <li> <h4>ToF Sensor Speed</h4> </li>
                                      <p class="mb-4">From the beginning, I decided to store any measurements on struct arrays before sending it via Bluetooth. This would allow me a faster measurement recording and hopefully more precise. To not waste any time in looking for measurements, I collected them only when a sensor was ready.
                                      This was possible through functions like myICM.dataReady() for the IMU and TOF_one.checkForDataReady() for each ToF sensor. When those flags were true, then measurements were recorded. Based on the results, I notice that the loop was roughly 12 times faster than each sensor (12 consecutives measurement were exactly the same with the same timestamps).
                                      The limiting factor are the ToF sensors as the slower sensors.</p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">When testing my first motor driver, I decided to hook it up to a DC Voltage generator and an oscilloscope to check if the soldering connection I had were correct and especially to check what the output voltage would be.
                                        According to my observation, and this can be seen also by the images below, the output to a motor will be approximately 10 times the voltage power from the battery (input of 3.7V will give an output of 37V) if it was to be hooked up alone.
                                        So by rapid calculation, each motor will roughly receive 17-18V from the battery given. Below is also the snippet of code used to test the motor. The voltage output is based on the battery we will use for the drivers, which is approximately of 3.7V.</p>

                                      <li> <h4>Lower limit PWM and Calibration </h4> </li>
                                        <p class="mb-4">The next step in lab was to discover the lower PWM value limit in both scenario os going straight and curving. Some considerations I noticed while testing is that the car has an inherent mechanical limitation based on the internal gears condition.
                                        So lower limit in PWM for other people in lab were not the same for me. After various trial on initial values, I ended up with a minimum inital PWM of 45 when going straight and of 120 when turning. I would need more testing on the turning value as I suspect my battery might have been low on power and therefore needing a higher value than needed.
                                        The next step was to apply a calibration factor to one of the motor drivers to ensure a more effective pairing of the two. Via the same testing, I noticed that my motor driver 2 was receiving less power than the other driver. So I decided to apply the calibration factor on it and ended up with a value of 15 when going forward and a value of 10 when going backwards.
                                        This is because I noticed that when going in reverse, the car had a greater drift than when going forward and I suspect is due to how the gears are shaped, preferring a direction compared to the other. No calibration seemed to be needed when turning, but I may implement one if necessary.</p>

                                    <li> <h4>Data via Bluetooth </h4> </li>
                                    <p class="mb-4">To send data fast enough, I decided to create two new commands. The first one, PID_DISTANCE_AIM, takes three variables (point_set, Kp, Kd).
                                    The second one, PID_DATA, takes no variables but it is responsible to send time, distance measurements and pwm values back for graphing purpose.
                                    To collect values, and later on send them, as fast as possible I implemented teh whole code in the main loop, which runs only when the Artemis receives the right command.
                                    To implement this, I created a flag with an int value associated with it so whenever the command is received, the flag receive the right value to be able to run. This allows the Bluetooth to be supported the whole time.
                                    To store as many values as possible for the graphs, I stored all data in arrays and then send it back on a second moment.</p>

                                    <li> <h4>PID Discussion </h4> </li>
                                      <p class="mb-4">Through various iterations, I developed a PD control system. As both graphs and video, show I managed to tune my PD controller to stop exactly at 1ft (304mm) from the wall.
                                      My process was to increment Kp until I almost crashed the car, finding a value that would stop the car just before the wall (overshooting) and would reverse creating then an oscillation scenario.
                                      I then introduced Kd, tuning until it would slow the car down when reaching the wall. I continued with the same process for different iterations to achieve better speed. <br>
                                      Additionally, I implemented the code so that the distance values used to calculate the PWM values would be updated depending on the ToF sampling rate.
                                      If the sensor had a new measurement, the distance would simply be the sensor output, otherwise the distance would be calculated by linear extrapolation using the two most recent distance measurements from the sensor.
                                      The linear extrapolation allowed me to speed up the car as we wouldn't be limited to just the PWM calculated whena sensor data was available. <br>
                                      Due to many issue with the Bluetooth disconnecting most of the time (unfortunately this issue is still going on), the following graph are just an example of what the ToF vs Time and PWM vs Time data are when the car drives.
                                      As it can be seen, apart for the first measurements which are imprecise due to the ToF tuning, the ToF vs Time show an exponential settling around 304mm as the car gets nearer.
                                      Similarly, the PWM values (which I called speed) oscillates positively and negatively (indicating forward and reverse) around the minimum PWM value I found, which is 45. <br>
                                      The two videos below show two occasions the car reached destination in two different places. For the videos, I used different PD values (Kp=0.28 and Kd=75 left, Kp=0.3 and Kd=45 right).
                                      The two different performances indicate how important the environment is to be able to tune the machine, which is consistent in the same terrain but not in different. <br>
                                      My preferred setting were for Kp = 0.3 and Kd = 75, which yielded the most consistent and fastest results. </p>

                                      <p class="mb-4">To send data fast enough, I decided to create two new commands. The first one, START_PID_STATIONARY, takes three variables (point_set, Kp, Kd).
                                      The second one, STOP_PID_STATIONARY, takes no variables but it is responsible to stop the motors and send back time and angle measurements and pwm values via Bluetooth.
                                      To collect values, and later on send them, as fast as possible I implemented the whole code in the main loop. When I send the first command, the implementation runs indefinitely until the second command is sent.
                                      When the first command is sent, all variables are use to implement PD control and a flag is activated so to allow the code below to be sent forever. While it runs, also other Bluetooth commands are possible to be sent, like the PD control implemented in Lab 5.
                                      For graphic purpose, when I send the second command all motors are turned off and all the data collected so far is sent back. </p>

                                        <p class="mb-4">Through various iterations, I developed a PD control system. As both graphs and video show, I managed to tune my PD controller to always come back to a decided angle I request even when moved by external forces. The decided angle for these tests was zero.
                                        My process was to increment Kp until it started oscillating, finding a value that would almost stop the car but the momentum would make teh car keep going (overshooting).
                                        I then introduced Kd, tuning until it would slow the car down when reaching the indicated angle. I continued with the same process for different iterations to achieve better speed and accuracy. <br>
                                        I implemented the code so that the angle values used to calculate the PWM values would be updated depending on the IMU sampling rate, using the yaw value calculated through the DMP process to minimize drift. This resulted in very effective and precise measurements, although showed a built in biased at the beginning of measuring.
                                        What I noticed was that the car would start measuring yaw at zero degrees but would keep increasing until settling around 3-5 degrees giving a constant biased. To mitigate this behaviour, I added a tolerance factor for which the car would not move if the angle was within that tolerance. <br>
                                        Reported below are the graphs for Angle vs Time from the IMU and PWM vs Time calculated for each new angle measured. In the first image, each spike represent a kick or movement of the car from the desired angle we want it to point (in this case 0 degrees). Each spike can either be positive or positive depending if the kick was right or left, and to recover from the spike the car gets back to its original position, plateauing at the desired angle.
                                        On the second image we can see that for each spike we had we have a spike on PWM values, which with the same behavior settles back to initial condition. To notice that for my car the minimal PWM value to move the car is 100. <br>
                                        The following video shows the behavior before explained. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">For this lab, we were tasked to develop an efficient Kalman Filter for our car. Since the hard task, we started by implementing and tuning the Kalman Filter on Python using Lab5 data collected previously. </p>

                                      <p class="mb-4">The first step was finding the drag and momentum of the car. From the data I collected in Lab5, I started by plotting a Velocity vs Time graph. This was done to observe around what value the velocity would be at steady state.
                                      Below here is the velocity graph I got, and based on the general shape I observed it follows an exponential trend which reaches steady state in between the red lines. From this informations, I calculated the steady state speed to be -0.2337m/sec.
                                      This value would be very important because it would have repercussions on the Arduino implementation of the Kalman Filter. <br>
                                      Using this velocity and the corresponding PWM value at steady state (63), I compared data and calculated the time at 90% to be 2.024sec. Using this 3 data, I calculated drag and momentum to be: </p>

                                      This is fundamental as we want to program the Kalman Filter to be fast as our loop. Moreover, I also initialised the C matrix, the initial guess for the state vector and the covariance matrices for process and sensor noises. Here below are reported with also their values. </p>

                                      <li> <h4>Kalman Filter in Arduino </h4> </li>
                                        <p class="mb-4">Now that we have a functioning Kalman Filter, I implemented it on Arduino using the BasicLinearAlgebra library. Setting up the same matrices explained before, I ran the car and see its behavior.
                                        The following graphs are the Distance vs Time and PWM vs Time using the Kalman Filter to speed up the distance calculations. The video illustrates the car behavior. <br>
                                        As you can see in the first graph, the line representing the distance measurements oscillates once it reaches the goal distance. The reason for this behavior is that even if we reached the desired goal, the Kalman Filter still tries to getr closer to the wall following the same trend (decreasing values) which led us here.
                                        When then it receives a ToF measurement, it snaps back into place as we gave more trust to our measurement. From the video, the car doesn't move while in this state although the motors try to since they are still receiving some non-zero pwm values. <br>
                                        Another challenge I faced during this lab was tuning the right values for the matrices of the Kalman Filter. As mentioned before, the critical adjustment I had to do was to tune better my steady state velocity calculations, as it then propagated in the B matrix.
                                        Through testing, I found a progressively lower speed, lowering than the value of the B matrix increasing the accuracy of my predictions in between ToF measurements. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">For this lab, we were tasked to perform a stunt with our car using all the infrastructure we have built so far. The stunt I decided to perform is a flip.
                                    The car would run forward full speed, with the ToF sensor and Kalman Filter outputting the current distance from teh wall we were. Thanks to that data, I would reverse at full speed to initiate the flip and come back to the starting point. <br>
                                    The were different ways to complete this stunt, but I found the easiest and most straightforward to keep it open-loop for its entirety. So both going forward and backward would be at max speed, with a time constraint to avoid crashing into object when coming back.
                                    I did plan to add PD control for the way back, but it resulted difficult to implement within the lab time. <br>
                                    Here below is the code I used, with also graphs showing the Distance vs Time and PWM vs Time during the whole stunt.

                                    <p class="mb-4">For this lab, we were tasked to perform a stunt with our car using all the infrastructure we have built so far. The stunt I decided to perform is a flip.
                                    The car would run forward full speed, with the ToF sensor and Kalman Filter outputting the current distance from teh wall we were. Thanks to that data, I would reverse at full speed to initiate the flip and come back to the starting point. <br>
                                    The were different ways to complete this stunt, but I found the easiest and most straightforward to keep it open-loop for its entirety. So both going forward and backward would be at max speed, with a time constraint to avoid crashing into object when coming back.
                                    I did plan to add PD control for the way back, but it resulted difficult to implement within the lab time. <br>
                                    Here below is the code I used, with also graphs showing the Distance vs Time and PWM vs Time during the whole stunt. The first graph presents the same issue explained in Lab 7, which is the oscillating behavior of the Kalman Filter. The second graph shows perfectly when the flip occurs, as the negatuve PWM value represents the reverse motion after the flip. <br>
                                    Most importantly, here are three well done flips and one blooper at the end for your enjoyment. By analysing the best run (the first one), my car travelled 1.8m (6ft) in 1.13sec for a speed of 1.59m/sec.</p>
